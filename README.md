Twitter Pic Android app
====================

Example Android project to load images from Twitter statuses. The app allows you to search images and preview those images in fullscreen which also shows the user that posted the picture.

##### Architecture
The architecture used in this project is similar to MVP with a mix of [VIPER](https://www.ckl.io/blog/ios-project-architecture-using-viper/). This architecture could be an over-kill for the project size. However, this is only intended as a proof-of-concept and template for another projects.

##### TODOs
There are still some work that isn't finished, like the error parsing.
